knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",

```

```{r setup}

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(devtools, RCurl, ggplot2, tidyverse, tidyquant)

install_github("p3lab/p3themes", dependencies = TRUE)

library(p3themes)
```

# Visualization 

Plot it without the P3 theme

```{r}
df <- p3themes::df

g <- ggplot(df, aes(experience2, fill = experience2)) + 
    geom_bar() + 
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(legend.position = "none")

g
```

Change labels and add title/substitle information

```{r}
g1 <- g + 
  labs(x = "Count of responses",
       y = "Organizing experience",
       title = "What was your experience with community organizing prior to joining\nthe Census effort with Houston in Action?",
       subtitle = "Organizer responses, n=8",
       caption = "Data source: Houston in Action 2020 Post-Program Survey")

g1
```

Now add the p3theme to the plot

```{r}

g2 <- add_p3theme(g1)

g2
```
